# Base64 Benchmarks

Benchmarks and optimized code for `elm/bytes`-based base64 encoding and decoding.

Based on [danfishgold/base64-bytes](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/danfishgold/base64-bytes/latest/). 

Always run benchmarks in `--optimize` mode: it matters a lot in this case.

```
elm make --optimize --output=index.html src/Main.elm 
```
